# AstronomyApp

#Story:
As a user, I want to see the Astronomy Picture of the Day, so that I can learn new things about our Universe everyday.

#Areas of Improvements
- Could have added the UnitTestCases together but couldnot do it because of time constraint
- Using storage as USerDefaults because the data is to be saved is small.
- Have tried using the best of MVVM architecture
- Tried to cover all the criterias
